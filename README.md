# Hangman-Game
This Python Hangman game challenges players to guess a randomly chosen word from a list within 12 attempts. It provides feedback on correct and incorrect guesses, validates user input, and displays the current state of the word with blanks for unguessed letters. The game ends when the player either guesses the word or runs out of attempts.
